#summary Common errors/problems encountered when running IR-GTS.

  * Invalid File Size: Make sure the file you're sending is either 136, 220 (B/W), or 236 (DPPTHGSS) bytes. 236-byte files are for GenIV, and won't work with B/W just yet.
  * "Socket Error Errno 10013 An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by it's access permissions": I believe this means that another program is using the necessary ports - I know I've seen Skype and Steam cause this error.
  * "Communication Error. Please turn off the power": If you're connecting to Black/White, this error will come up if you use the version of IR-GTS for Gen IV. Note that IR-GTS-BW is a separate release for Black/White compatibility.


Several people have been connecting to the actual GTS, despite inputting the DNS settings correctly into the DS. I'm not yet sure what is causing this, but am looking into it. If you are using a USB device to connect your DS to the internet, try setting your computer's DNS to 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, try deleting all other connections in the DS settings, as it may be accessing a different network than the one IR-GTS is running on.
